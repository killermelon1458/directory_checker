This is my file existence checker. I have many usb hard drives that sometime disconnect 
for some reason or the other. I and many other people access data from them at random times remotly so this is 
a way to get notified if one disconnects so i can reconnect it as soon as possible. pythonEmailNotify.py is a 
separate module i made for the email notification. It has its own repository
